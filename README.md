*NewSumWidget* is an effort to port NewSum on the web and on the desktop

**NewSum Widget Files**

The Files are split in the current way: 

1. NewSumWebSite

	Is the repo for the web NewSum

2. NewSumWidgets:

	- NewSumWindowsWidget
	- NewSumKDEWidget
	- NewSumIgoogleWidget
	- NewSumMacWidget
	* All of the above contain the files for each separate widget

		* All of the above require:
		- NewSumServerFilesWidget,
		Which runs in the server and contains the server files for the app to function
